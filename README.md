# Happy Numbers

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number), a happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit.  For example, 13 is a happy number, because `(1*1) + (3*3) = 10 and (1*1) + (0*0) = 1`.  On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number, because `(4*4) = 16, (1*1) + (6*6) = 37, (3*3) + (7*7) = 58, (5*5) + (8*8) = 89, (8*8) + (9*9) = 145, (1*1) + (4*4) + (5*5) = 42, (4*4) + (2*2) = 20 and (2*2) = 4 and repeats without reaching 1`.  The aim is to implement the project using HTML Forms.
